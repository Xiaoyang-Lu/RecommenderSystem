# RecommenderSystem
Design and implement a Movie Recommender System using Map Reduce

The project I will use the Netflix data, according users' Viewing history to recommend movies for them and making the films more in line with their appetite.

Using the item collaborative filtering algorithm, the user's rating matrix of the film and the co-occurrence matrix of the film (that is, the similarity matrix between the films) is obtained from the Netflix data. Finally, the co-occurrence matrix and the rating matrix are merged, then get a recommended list.

This project I implement five Map Reduce Job links to all the processes to achieve the most important Map Reduce version matrix multiplication.
